Lack of challenge in the open sea? and open air? This mod is for you.

## IMPORTANT!!

The enemies design to be on [Virentis](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/virentis) (next update) which mean it harder than pentapods, so play at your own risk.

Right now it only available on Gleba, but it didn't make sense if you don't increase water or use mods like [On Wayward Seas](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/wayward-seas) or [Depths of Nauvis](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/depths_of_nauvis).

## Recommend settings

On Wayward Seas + Enable only Gleba.

Reduce health percentage in mod settings if you feel struggle.
