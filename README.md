Lack of challenge in the open sea? and open air? This mod is for you.

## IMPORTANT!!

The enemies design to be on [Virentis](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/virentis) (next update) which mean it harder than pentapods, and the counter weapon [Ballista](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ballista-turret) is enable after Gleba, so play at your own risk.

Right now it available on Nauvis and Gleba, but it didn't make sense if you don't increase water or use mods like [On Wayward Seas](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/wayward-seas) or [Depths of Nauvis](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/depths_of_nauvis).

## Recommend settings

On Wayward Seas + Enable only Gleba.

Reduce health percentage in mod settings if you struggle.

## Features

Add 4 new enemy, weak against "piercing" damage type

- Cannoniere: shoot long range explosive cannon, low health but destructive
- Frigate: tough, shoot barrels full of pentapod
- Zeppelin: (flying) spawn skirmisher and spread fire on their path
- Skirmisher: (flying) fast, swarm, annoying
